# cs50_wiki_project
My wiki project as part of the cs50 Web Programming course, written in Django. I am very new to coding and web development so any critiques of what I have done or suggestions for improvement are welcome!

Link to the project specifications can be found here - https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/

Most of the functionality has been implemented as per the project specifications. However, there are still a few outstanding issues that I will fix at a later date:

    Currently the site will only work with article titles of one word. Creating an article with a multi-word title will mean that going to that article will give a 404 error.

    Styling improvements
